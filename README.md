Centralize input parsing and validation logic further.
Explore external configuration files (e.g., JSON, YAML) for settings like SLEEP time.
Refine error handling, especially for future file I/O (like loading/saving).
Consider adding type hinting for function signatures and variables (Python 3.5+).
Evaluate potential code duplication (e.g., menu display logic after invalid input).
Add a requirements.txt file (even if only standard library for now).
Enhance comments where complex logic might arise later.
