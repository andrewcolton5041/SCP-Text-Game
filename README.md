Combat Rolls: We know he has Firearms (Handgun) 50%. We could add a basic entry similar to Rook's, maybe assuming a standard handgun damage like 1D10? Answer: Yes

Background: We can copy/paste or summarize the relevant text:
specialization: "Independent Anomalous Investigator / Info-broker specializing in GoIs"
reason_joining_found: N/A (or "Unknown/Independent")
ideology: "Pragmatic, cautious, cynical but possesses a hidden ethical core. Seeks to expose/stop GoI-███."
contact: Potentially Agent Rook, or maybe "Classified".
incidents: "Tracked Aris Thorne's research independently."
possession: "Datachip or encrypted communicator" (mentioned in description).
description: Copy the description text here.
Inventory: This is less defined than Rook's. He likely has his communicator, maybe a weapon (given the handgun skill), and basic gear. We could start with a minimal inventory or leave it empty for now. What seems appropriate?
Status Flags: The [DEV NOTE] gives us specific flags to include:
met_argus: false (initially)
argus_trust_level: We need an initial value. Maybe start at 50?
